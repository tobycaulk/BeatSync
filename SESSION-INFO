session
==========
playlist OR track ids
PIN
status

1. Clients constantly poll for session status, default is "WAITING"
2. When lead hits "Start" button, server changes session status to "VALIDATE" and sends track data + intended start time to next client poll request
3. When client receives "MAP" status + data, client maps out tracks and returns the track data to be validated. 
   Server should check if it has already received data from a client, and if it already has then change it's returned status to "VALIDATE"
   "VALIDATE" status is ignored by client because the server is just waiting for all data to validate before making a "START" or "MAP" decision
4. Server validates track data upon receiving all client's data and:
    4a. If all data is validated properly and it is still before the intended start time then server changes status to "START"
    4b. If any data is not validated properly or the intended start time has been passed then server changes status to "MAP"
